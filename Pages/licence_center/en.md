## Categories
The ifrOSS License Center collects licenses for free content and assigns them to different license types. These are organized into the following categories:

* [ğŸš§ Freie Software und Open Source Lizenzen]()
* [ğŸš§ Open Content Licences]()
* [ğŸš§ Open Data Licences()
* [ğŸš§ Open Hardware Licence]()
* [ğŸš§ Other Free Licenses]()
* [ğŸš§ Similar Licences, that do not meet the requirements of the OSI Definition]()
* [ğŸš§ Ethical Licenses]()
* [ğŸš§ Public Domain Statements]()
* [ğŸš§ Open AI Licences]()
 
This makes finding and characterizing new licenses easier. As new licenses are constantly being created, appear in new versions or are no longer accessible under their old URL, everyone's participation in updating this list is welcome.
